          Hello, my name is Nabil. I am a web designer who is learning to create
          websites and is currently carving out a journey to become a full stack
          developer, which is quite a complicated journey for me to master
          alone, but I will continue to try my best.

            Hello, my name is Nabil, as I said earlier, I am a Web Designer who
            wants to go to the next level, namely Full Stack Developer.

          <p>
            I went to school at SMK Muhammadiyah 2 Boja, middle school at Nurul
            Islami, elementary school at SDN Purwoyoso 04. I have quite a lot of
            shortcomings, but I will be the best in the future. Hopefully..
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case, I still have a lot to learn and understand, I'm still
            a bit ignorant about my field, therefore I will continue to try as
            best as I can, with support and encouragement from the people around
            me, I'm sure I can do it.

              <p>
                Introducing my first web project, namely a web dashboard called
                Mainten-Web, this website is used to easily maintain a server,
                this dashboard is very user friendly or easy to use even for
                beginners. This website also provides Terminal and storage
                monitoring features as well as networking monitoring to check
                that your hardware and software is working properly and there
                are no problems at all.

                automotive lovers and other things, this website is actually not
                finished yet so this website is currently under construction, on
                this website I provide a Chat Service feature using bots to
                replace the existing Customer Service/CS will help you if there
                are problems with the website.

              <h3>Project 3 (Status : Developing)</h3>
              <p>
                In this project, I created a website for selling car spare
                parts, especially for famous cars, which is connected in a
                collab with this website and this shop. I created this website
                to just learn to create a new design for a buying and selling
                website.
